README for Solitaire Solver
by Stephen Mayhew

This solitaire solver is a Python program that will solve a Klondike 
solitaire game using OpenCV. 

The program flow is as follows:
    - runner.py has the main loop 
        - Inside this loop, processCards.py is called. This takes a screenshot, 
            and finds and extracts card data.
        - This data is passed to SolitaireSolver.py which uses that data to decide 
            on the next move. It moves the mouse, and makes the next move. It also
            checks to see if the game is over.
            
==============================================================
To run it:
    1. Open up the Klondike game in AisleRiot Solitaire (make sure it is full screen)
    2. cd to the SolitaireSolver directory
    3. Type in the command line:
        $ python runner.py
    4. Quickly change windows 

==============================================================
Dependencies:
    - OpenCV (package opencv)
    - Python Bindings for OpenCV (package python-opencv)
    - Pymouse (get it from https://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse)

==============================================================
Notes:
    - I developed this using Ubuntu 10.04, 32-bit, Intel processor
    - The screen resolution is important because the mouse clicking logic has some 
        hard-coded numbers. I know, I know, it should be fixed, but this is the 
        'hack-together' version. My screen resolution is 1920x1200.
        

==============================================================
Known bugs:
    - Infinite loop if there are 2 or more recurring moves


This is an arbitrary edit.
