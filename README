README for Solitaire Solver
by Stephen Mayhew

This solitaire solver is a Python program that will solve a Klondike 
solitaire game using OpenCV. 

The program flow is as follows:
    - runner.py has the main loop 
        - Inside this loop, processCards.py is called. This takes a screenshot, 
            and finds and extracts card data.
        - This data is passed to SolitaireSolver.py which uses that data to decide 
            on the next move. It moves the mouse, and makes the next move. It also
            checks to see if the game is over.
            
==============================================================
To run it:
    1. Open up the Klondike game in AisleRiot Solitaire (make sure it is full screen)
    2. cd to the SolitaireSolver directory
    3. Type in the command line:
        $ python runner.py
    4. Quickly change windows so that the Solitaire window is maximized in the front. 

==============================================================
Dependencies:
    - OpenCV (package opencv) (4.19.2013: no longer available)
    - Python Bindings for OpenCV (package python-opencv)
    - Pymouse (get it from https://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse)
    - XLib (package: python-xlib)
    - Pytesser (get it here: https://code.google.com/p/pytesser/)
    - Tesseract (package: tesseract-ocr)


==============================================================
Notes:
    - I developed this using Ubuntu 10.04, 32-bit, Intel processor
    - My screen resolution is 1920x1200.The screen resolution is 
        important because the mouse clicking logic has some hard-coded 
        numbers. I know, I know, it should be fixed, but this is the 
        'hack-together' version. 
        
==============================================================
Known bugs/problems:
    - Infinite loop if there are 2 or more recurring moves
    - Sometimes mouse clicks don't register (usually happens when a 
        pile is stacked very deep)
